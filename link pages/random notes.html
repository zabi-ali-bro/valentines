This I do know: I want to be present, authentic, and steady in every opportunity I get. I want to be someone who cares, not only when everything is going well and it doesn’t cost me much, but when everything isn’t going well, when the world feels heavy, and when someone feels like they’re all alone.",
      "Trust is not easy to offer, and in many ways, it is even more difficult to earn. I realize that. However, I do believe in proving myself not by words, but by actions actions that express care, respect, and integrity. I may not be flawless, and I might make some mistakes along the way, but I would like to be genuine, authentic, and down-to-earth in my dealings with people. I would like to be the one who will listen, support, and stand by people in both their triumphant and tough experiences in life.",
      "Distance, situations, and miscommunications can surely come between us, but I believe in being there in presence as well as in effort. I try to demonstrate that although life may be complicated and the world may make trusting a challenge, it is still possible to be authentic, to display concern, and to establish a connection. I try to be a reminder that a person can be there in the good times as well as in the tough times. No person has to go through all of it alone.",

For me, life is not about huge promises or lots of words. It is about actions that show respect, care, and thinking. I would like to continue to prove myself not to please others but to be someone dependable, someone to listen to, someone to appreciate moments with, someone to count in.",
